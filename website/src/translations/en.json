      "tw": "I developed applications using NestJs for the backend and React for the frontend, integrating the VTEX ecommerce platform into one of the projects. Additionally, I collaborated in the creation of a web chat application for the Todo Mejora Foundation, using React JS for the frontend and Firestore for data storage. In this project, I also made modifications to a cloud function responsible for receiving and sending messages. Moreover, I worked on improving the deployment flow, automating the task of creating environment tags through GitHub Actions. As a Senior Developer Consultant, I participated in technical decision-making and led the team in implementing efficient solutions.",
      "option": "I worked as a Full Stack Developer on a project for a mining company. In this project, I developed web applications using ReactJS as the Front-end library, which displayed information about the company's assets. The application includes the generation of dashboards to display the information processed by the ETLs. At the Back-end level, I used Docker container along with the Python Flask framework to generate an API orchestrated by Fargate in AWS. In addition, the Back-end application also served as a maintainer and viewer of the dashboard.",
      "arkho": "During my work experience, I have developed skills in web application development using technologies such as Angular v7/8 and databases in RDS. I have also participated in the creation of ETL using a variety of AWS services including Lambda, Step Functions, Athena, Glue, SQS, Redshift, and S3. Additionally, I have implemented chatbots for web pages, where I have worked on styling configuration and creating lambdas responsible for maintenance, using Elastic Search for data storage. Finally, I have developed an integration between systems to generate reports and progress notifications for projects through an external API. These skills have allowed me to be successful in complex projects and a high-pressure environment.",
      "karibu": "As a Full Stack Developer, I developed web applications using the Nuxt Front-end framework, and in the backend, I used NodeJs with Express to create RESTful APIs. I implemented secure storage of credentials and information on the Front-end using the Vuex library and used Firebase for user authentication and Front-end deployment of the application. I also deployed the backend on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and used the GCP database to store the application data.",
      "ssilva": "I worked as a Frontend Developer on a web system project for a real estate company, where I developed components using the VueJs framework and used the Vuex library to implement secure access credentials storage on the Front-end layer.
